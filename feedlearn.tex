\begin{abstract}
Many long-term goals, such as learning a language, require people to spend a small amount of time each day to achieve them. At the same time, people regularly browse social news feeds in their spare time. Our system, FeedLearn, teaches vocabulary in the context of Facebook feeds, by showing users interactive quizzes they can answer without leaving their feeds. It is implemented as a Chrome extension, as Facebook's API does not currently allow developers to insert interactive content into feeds. In our preliminary user study, we compared Japanese vocabulary learning rates when interactive quizzes were inserted directly into feeds, versus inserting links that lead them to quizzes. Our results suggest that users learn more and engage more with microlearning tasks when quizzes can be done without leaving their feeds.
% In our preliminary user study, we find that over the course of a week, we are able to teach students an average of 13 new vocabulary words by injecting microlearning tasks into their Facebook feeds. This is more than the 4 vocabulary words learned if we insert links leading them to visit an external site to study, as is done by current Facebook apps.
% Unlike apps like Duolingo posting accomplishments in users' feeds, FeedLearn gives friends a simple call to action and allows them to participate in their friends' learning processes.
%In our first study, we find that over the course of 2 weeks, we are able to teach students N new vocabulary words by injecting microlearning tasks into their Facebook feeds. This is X\% more than a control condition where we ask them to visit a separate website and ask them to study the words on their own time, and Y\% more than a control condition where we show friends' achievements via feed updates. In our second study, we find that giving friends the ability to participate in the social learning process, by suggesting words for their friends to learn, leads to increased engagement. They learn more words in a condition where the words learned are suggested to the group by their friends, which is X\% more than when they select words to choose by themselves, and Y\% more than when the suggestions are automatic.

\section{Introduction}

People spend large amounts of time reading their news feeds on social networking sites like Facebook.
71\% of American adults with an internet connection use Facebook. Of these, 63\% visit Facebook at least once a day, and 40\% visit it multiple times per day \cite{socialmediaupdate}. Among American college students, 90\% use Facebook \cite{collegefacebook2}. College students who use Facebook report spending an average of 30 minutes per day on Facebook \cite{collegefacebook}. Clearly, Facebook news feeds present an opportunity for influencing the behavior of users.

In this paper, we present FeedLearn, a technique for allowing users to interactively study flashcard-like content, such as vocabulary, as they browse through their Facebook feeds. Our research questions are:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Are people more likely to engage with microlearning tasks if they can do so without leaving their Facebook feeds?
\item Do in-feed questions result in higher learning outcomes than the links to external sites used by current Facebook applications?
% \item Does the regularity and frequency with which users visit Facebook make it suitable for microlearning?
%\item Are people more likely to learn if they are shown small, easily actionable learning tasks in the social feed. %, instead of messages emphasizing friends' overall achievements?
%\item  Are people more likely to do flashcards that their friends suggested for them to do, as opposed to flashcards they selected themselves, or flashcards suggested by the system?
%\item  Are people more likely to do flashcards that they suggested to their friends for them to do, as opposed to flashcards they selected only for themselves, or flashcards suggested by the system?
%\item Does the act of suggesting words for friends to learn improve users' engagement with the system, or perceived satisfaction?
%\item Does the selection process result in something useful?
\end{compactitem}

Our preliminary user study compared Japanese vocabulary acquisition rates through FeedLearn's in-feed interactive quizzes, versus inserting links to an external website where they can do quizzes, as is currently done by Facebook applications. We found that users answered more quizzes when they could do so without leaving the feed, and they learned more new words on average over a week. % when they could do the quizzes inside the feeds.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Microlearning}

Microlearning is a strategy of using short periods of time throughout the day to study. It has been used for applications such foreign vocabulary learning via mobile apps \cite{microlearning} \cite{micromandarin}. A weakness of needing a separate app for microlearning is that it requires the user to interrupt their routine and open an app to study. %vAlthough they may give users reminders when they should practice, these reminders might come at the wrong time, or be ignored.

Some systems have attempted to solve this problem by embedding microlearning into other contexts. There are games where users complete learning tasks while playing \cite{carriearcade}, video players which teach vocabulary while watching foreign-language videos \cite{smartsubtitles}, screensavers that show facts while the screen is idle \cite{screensaver}, and chat clients that show vocabulary while the user is chatting \cite{waitlearning}.

Compared to the learning contexts used by existing work, we believe the Facebook feed is an especially good opportunity for microlearning, because:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Unlike playing educational games or watching foreign-language videos, visiting Facebook is part of the daily routine of nearly half of American adults with an internet connection \cite{socialmediaupdate} %, and the majority of college students \cite{collegefacebook}.
% \item Unlike a screensaver which is dismissed once the mouse moves, users can interact with quizzes they see in their Facebook feeds.
\item Unlike needing to respond to a chat message, there are no interruptions to the user's learning while they are browsing their Facebook feeds.
\item Users are already used to a variety of rich content appearing in their Facebook feeds, such as videos, games, recommendations, and advertisements.
%\item Users are already used to a variety of rich content appearing in their Facebook feeds, such as videos their friends liked, posts from games and apps, recommendations, and advertisements.
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{News Feeds as a Persuasive Technology}

Many apps attempt to use Facebook feeds as a persuasive technology. For example, apps like Duolingo can broadcast users' study progress on the platform, inviting the user's friends to participate in the activity. %A key advantage that social platforms like Facebook provide is that friends can be associated with requests, increasing their potential persuasiveness via social pressures \cite{foggfacebook}.
%Since the emergence of the Facebook app development platform, there have been
%many attempts to use it as a platform for persuasion. For example, apps like NikePlus can broadcast users' running progress, and apps like Duolingo can broadcast users' study progress on the platform. These messages may also invite the user's friends to participate in the activity. A key advantage that social platforms like Facebook provide is that friends can be associated with requests, increasing their potential persuasiveness via social pressures \cite{foggfacebook}.

However, there are many caveats with such applications auto-posting messages on users' feeds. Messages auto-posted by applications receive little attention from the user's friends, compared to messages that they have posted themselves. Viewers may perceive these posts as either trivial achievements or bragging, ignoring them \cite{socialsharing}. % It is thus suggested that these auto-posted messages be shared only with the subset of the user's friends who are likely to be interested. However, users are unwilling to invest the effort to identify these social circles \cite{socialsharing}.

\subsection{Study groups on Facebook}

There are a number of Facebook pages that post daily ``word of the day'' style lessons for learners, such as KoreanClass101. If users subscribe to these pages (by clicking the Like button), they will see periodic reminders to visit an external site to study vocabulary, as shown in \autoref{fig:learn-korean}. These services have a number of weaknesses that FeedLearn aims to address:

%}

\begin{compactitem}
\item Not interactive: users need to visit an external site to do quizzes or see other words.
\item Not personalized: all 70 thousand subscribers will see the same daily word posted, regardless of whether they already know that word.
\item No spaced repetition: a new word is posted each day, and older words are never repeated.
\item Content needs to be manually generated: a group moderator needs to write a new post each day
\end{compactitem}

\section{FeedLearn Interface}

FeedLearn inserts interactive vocabulary quizzes into users' Facebook feeds, as shown in \autoref{fig:feedlearn}. It is implemented as a Chrome extension, as Facebook's API does not currently allow developers to insert interactive content into feeds. FeedLearn supports multiple languages, but this paper will focus on learning basic Japanese nouns. % FeedLearn supports multiple languages, but this paper will focus on the version that teaches basic Japanese nouns.

\subsection{Quiz Types}

One type of quiz presents a noun in English, and asks the user to select the corresponding Japanese word, as shown in \autoref{fig:quiz1}. To ensure that users learn word associations in both ways, we also have a second type of quiz, where the user is shown a word in Japanese and selects the corresponding word in English, as shown in \autoref{fig:quiz2}.
% To ensure that users learn word associations in both ways, we also have a second type of quiz, where the user is shown a word in Japanese and selects the corresponding word in English, as shown in \autoref{fig:quiz2}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{quiz1}
\caption{One type of quiz presents a noun in Japanese (\textit{jikan}), and asks the user to select its meaning (time).}
\label{fig:quiz1}
\end{figure}

\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{quiz2}
\caption{Another type of quiz presents a noun in English (umbrella), and asks the user to select the correct translation into Japanese (\textit{kasa}). The user has incorrectly selected \textit{fukuro}, so the user is shown its meaning (bag), and tries again.}
\label{fig:quiz2}
\end{figure}

We opted to use this multiple-choice quiz format, because it tests the user's knowledge with a minimal amount of interaction -- the user simply clicks on a word to answer. Once the user answers a quiz correctly, a new quiz testing a different word is shown. Thus, users can continue to study vocabulary in their feed for as long as they wish to.

% A picture is also presented alongside the foreign-language word, to help learners visually remember them. Prior research has shown that flashcards showing a picture along with the text allow learners to learn vocabulary better than text-only flashcards \cite{multimediavocabulary}. We focus on nouns, because they are the most common type of word -- the majority of words in the Oxford English dictionary are nouns \cite{microlearning} -- and they are relatively easy to visualize. This is the same quiz style used by Duolingo to introduce nouns.

% We opt to use this interactive quiz format, rather than simply showing pairs of words and translations or asking users to explicitly recall and type out translations for words, because it allows us to take advantage of the testing effect with a minimal amount of interaction -- the user simply clicks on a word to answer. Once the user answers a quiz correctly, a new quiz testing a different word is shown. Thus, users can continue to study in their feed for as long as they wish to.

 \subsection{Quiz Generation}

Our words and definitions were taken from the Nouns section of Wiktionary's 1000 Basic Japanese Words list. We excluded loanwords that users would easily recognize (\textit{pinku}=pink), and words that are homographs when romanized (\textit{hana}=flower or nose). We focus on nouns, because they are the most common type of word \cite{microlearning}. % -- the majority of words in the Oxford English dictionary are nouns % FeedLearn can optionally show the word in the native script (kana/kanji for Japanese), or display a picture of the word. However, we did not show these in our user study, because our users could not read Japanese scripts, and not all words can be visualized with a picture (ex: year).

\subsection{Spaced Repetition}

Spaced repetition algorithms schedule items for review to ensure long-term retention \cite{spacedrepetition}. We modified the Memreflex algorithm \cite{memreflex} to show the word due for review that has been seen least recently in the feed, as opposed to always showing the most overdue word as Memreflex does. This ensures that users will continue to see different words as they are scrolling through their feeds, even if they are not always answering the in-feed questions.

% Quizzes are generated automatically from the provided English word. The other options are generated by looking up the word in WordNet \cite{wordnet}, to find related words that have similar category and semantics but have different meaning (for example, other animal names). The images are obtained by taking the first result on Google Images. We select the list of words to teach based on their overall usefulness in the language (as judged by word frequency in natural-language text).

%\subsection{Inserting Quizzes into Feeds}

%We insert quizzes into feeds so that they will be encountered at a rate of 1 quiz every 10 posts. We picked this rate, as this was similar to the frequency we observed advertisements and sponsored content appearing in Facebook news feeds. Hence, our should not distract users any more than existing advertisements. %on Facebook. % This is optimal because (need justification).

\section{Preliminary User Study}

We conducted a preliminary user study to compare the effectiveness of inserting interactive quizzes directly into users' Facebook feeds, versus inserting links to the quizzes as is commonly done on Facebook today. % We compared the 

\subsection{Participants}

We recruited 12 users who had not previously studied Japanese but were interested in learning some basic vocabulary.  5 were female, 7 male.They were voluntary participants recruited from online forums and Facebook groups related to Japanese culture. All of our participants self-reported that they were regular users of Facebook. %, spending at least 10 minutes on the site each day.

% We conducted a 2-week between-subjects user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our system in teaching foreign-language vocabulary.

% We recruited 30 college students with no prior exposure to Japanese, who were interested in learning some basic vocabulary in Japanese. All of our participants were regular users of Facebook, spending at least 10 minutes on the site each day.

\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{feedlearn-link-screenshot}
\caption{The control condition in our user study inserted a link into users' Facebook feeds that led them to a site where they could do vocabulary quizzes}
\label{fig:control}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Materials}

We used 50 basic Japanese words from Wiktionary's Basic Japanese Words list as the study material. We presented vocabulary words in romanized form instead of Japanese scripts, as our users could not read Japanese scripts.

%We selected the 30 most frequently used non-abstract nouns in Japanese, and generated flashcards automatically for them, according to the procedure described in the Quiz Generation section. We presented vocabulary words in romanized form rather than the standard Japanese orthography, to avoid difficulties resulting from unfamiliarity with the Japanese writing system.

\subsection{Conditions}

Users were assigned to one of two conditions:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Users in the \textit{in-feed quiz} condition had quizzes inserted directly in their feeds, as shown in \autoref{fig:feedlearn}.
\item Users in the \textit{link} condition had links inserted into their feed which led them to a site where they could do the quizzes, as shown in \autoref{fig:control}.
\end{compactitem}

Apart form the different items (quizzes/links) inserted into the feed, the questions and quiz interfaces were identical in the two conditions. In both conditions, the items were inserted at a rate of 1 quiz/link per 10 feed items. We chose this rate because it was approximately the rate at which we observed sponsored content and advertisements to appear in our feeds.

% There were 3 conditions in our study. We assigned 10 students to each:

\subsection{Procedure}

The study was conducted entirely online. First, users took a pre-test on the words we were intending to teach them, where they tried matching the 50 Japanese words to their 50 English definitions. Then they installed our Chrome extension and used it to study the 50 words for a week. After a week, we asked them users to do the post-test, which had the same format as the pre-test.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Vocab Quiz Results}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{vocab-test-scores}
\caption{Vocabulary test scores for the in-feed quiz and link conditions, with standard error bars}
\label{fig:vocab-test-scores}
\end{figure}

Average vocabulary pre-test and post-test scores are shown in \autoref{fig:vocab-test-scores}. On average, users in the in-feed condition learned 13.2 new words, compared to 2.5 new words learned in the link condition. However, this was not statistically significant (t=1.51, p=0.16).

\subsection{Logged Interactions}

The number of times users practiced answering quizzes is shown in \autoref{fig:event-logs}. We also kept track of ``study sessions'', which we defined as the number of times the user clicked on the link to visit the external website (in the link condition), or first answered a quiz that was inserted into their feed (in the in-quiz condition). % We also show number of answers and sessions normalized by the number of feed insertions to normalize for amounts of Facebook use.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{event-logs-feedlearn}
\caption{Average number of events logged per user for the in-feed quiz and link conditions.}
\label{fig:event-logs}
\end{figure}

On average, we found that users in the in-feed quiz condition answered significantly more quizzes than the link condition, did more study sessions, and studied on more days across the week. We believe this difference is due to the decreased barrier to starting a study session in the in-feed condition, as they do not need to leave the feed.

%\subsection{Qualitative Feedback}

Some users mentioned that they would prefer words to be explicitly introduced first before they start appearing in quizzes.  In addition, as shown by our ``ratio of study sessions to insertions'', even in the in-feed condition, users only interact with 1/4 of quizzes that they see. Hence, we need to ensure that seeing items reinforces memory, even if users do not interact with them. Later versions of FeedLearn address this issue with a new type of item that introduces new words and reinforces memory for old ones.

\section{Conclusion}

FeedLearn uses Facebook feeds for vocabulary microlearning.
By eliminating the need to leave the Facebook feed to do quizzes, FeedLearn reduces the barrier
required to start microlearning tasks. Our user study found that eliminating the need to click a link to start studying vocabulary results in increased engagement.

Although we have focused on vocabulary, other content could also be microlearned in the context of social feeds.  In-feed messages encouraging small, actionable tasks could also be used to promote habits such as microexercise.

Future work includes using a model to determine the optimal times to insert microlearning tasks into feeds. Another potential extension is making the microlearning tasks more integrated with the Facebook environment to create a more social in-feed learning experience. %Future work includes better integrating the microlearning tasks with the the social nature of the Facebook environment to create a richer in-feed learning experience.

%Although we have focused on vocabulary learning, this approach can potentially be applied to other educational content, or even be used to encourage other small, actionable behaviors such as microexercise. % One could also use a similar mechanism to encourage other behaviors that need to be done for short periods of time on a daily basis, such as small amounts of exercise.

%Potential future work includes using an adaptive model to determine the optimal times to insert microlearning tasks into feeds.

% The study is conducted entirely online. First, we ask the users to take a pre-test, to verify that they do not already know the vocabulary that we intend to teach them. The test is a multiple choice test: there are 30 questions total, with 15 questions where questions where the user is given the foreign-language word and is asked to select the correct English translation, and 15 questions where the user is given a word in English and is asked to select the correct foreign translation.

% Then, we have them install our extension have them use the service for 2 weeks (according to the condition they have been assigned to). After the 2 weeks have elapsed, we again ask them to take the vocabulary quiz.

%\subsection{Research Questions}

%H1: Do users learn more vocabulary in the FeedLearn condition than the other conditions?

%H2: Do user engage more (complete more quizzes) in the FeedLearn condition than the other conditions?

%H3: Do users enjoy the FeedLearn condition more than the other conditions?

%\section{Results}

%H1: Hopefully, we find that the amount of vocabulary learned in the FeedLearn condition is greater than the other two conditions

%H2: Hopefully, we find the users engage more (complete more quizzes) in the FeedLearn condition than the other conditions.

%H3: Hopefully, we find that users find injection of quizzes directly into their Facebook feeds less distracting than injection of reminders for them to visit the site, or email-based reminders.

% \section{Discussion}

% Although in all 3 conditions, users receive daily reminders to go study vocabulary, we found that users complete more quizzes in the FeedLearn condition, and consequently learn more vocabulary.

% Relative to the External Service with In-Feed Reminders condition, we can attribute this to the reduced friction required for the interaction: the user no longer needs to leave their news feed and visit an external service to review vocabulary, so the barrier to engagement is lowered by inserting vocabulary quizzes directly into social feeds.

% Relative to the External Service with Email Reminders condition, we can additionally attribute an advantage to being able to catch them when they are idle and free. While the user may be busy at 10AM and not have time when they receive the email to review the vocabulary, and will consequently have to remember to go visit the site at a later time, users in the FeedLearn condition have already indicated that they are free and idle because they are browsing their news feed, and are hence more likely to be available to review vocabulary when they encounter them in their feeds.

% Users found the FeedLearn condition more enjoyable and less distracting than the External Service with Email Remdiners condition, because they were able to directly go engage with the quiz content, and were not distracted by unnecessary reminder emails.
